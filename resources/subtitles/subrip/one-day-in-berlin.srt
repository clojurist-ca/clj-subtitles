1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:25,500
Two thousand years ago, two thousand years ago the proudest boast was "civis Romanus sum."

2
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:37,800
Today, in the world of freedom, the proudest boast is "Ich bin ein Berliner."

3
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,500
It was a great day in the history of Berlin

4
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,500
June, 26 1963

100
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,400
I am proud

102
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,400
to come to this city

103
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:31,000
as the guest of your distinguished Mayor,

104
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:38,000
who has symbolized throughout the world the fighting spirit of West Berlin.

105
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:47,000
And I am proud

106
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:53,000
And I am proud to visit the Federal Republic

107
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:59,000
with your distinguished Chancellor who for so many years

108
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:06,000
has committed Germany to democracy and freedom and progress,

110
00:16:07,487 --> 00:16:18,500
and to come here in the company of my fellow American, General Clay, who

111
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:32,023
who has been in this city during its great moments of crisis and will come again if ever needed.

112
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:57,200
Two thousand years ago, two thousand years ago the proudest boast was "civis Romanus sum."

113
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:07,000
Today, in the world of freedom, the proudest boast is "Ich bin ein Berliner."

114
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:25,500
I …, I …, I appreciate, I appreciate my interpreter translating my German!

115
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:47,000
There are many people in the world who really don't understand, or say they don't,

116
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:54,500
what is the great issue between the free world and the Communist world.

117
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Let them come to Berlin!

118
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:15,500
There are some who say …, there are some who say that communism is the wave of the future.

119
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,000
Let them come to Berlin!

120
00:18:20,288 --> 00:18:27,379
And there are some who say in Europe and elsewhere we can work

121
00:18:27,379 --> 00:18:32,742
with the Communists. Let them come to Berlin!

122
00:18:36,527 --> 00:18:47,673
And there are even a few who say that it's true that communism is an evil system,

123
00:18:47,673 --> 00:18:52,712
but it permits us to make economic progress.

124
00:18:52,712 --> 00:18:58,958
Lass' sie nach Berlin kommen! Let them come to Berlin!

125
00:19:04,484 --> 00:19:14,605
Freedom has many difficulties and democracy is not perfect, but we have never had

126
00:19:14,605 --> 00:19:18,950
to put a wall up to keep our people in, to prevent them from leaving us.

127
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:39,700
I want to say, on behalf of my countrymen, who live many miles away

128
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:48,283
on the other side of the Atlantic, who are far distant from you, that they take the greatest pride

129
00:19:48,283 --> 00:19:58,032
that they have been able to share with you, even from a distance, the story of the last 18 years.

130
00:19:58,032 --> 00:20:10,188
I know of no town, no city, that has been besieged for 18 years that still lives

131
00:20:10,188 --> 00:20:19,070
with the vitality and the force, and the hope and the determination of the city of West Berlin.

132
00:20:33,001 --> 00:20:43,195
While the wall is the most obvious and vivid demonstration of the failures of the Communist system,

133
00:20:43,195 --> 00:20:53,467
for all the world to see, we take no satisfaction in it, for it is, as your Mayor has said,

134
00:20:53,467 --> 00:21:01,652
an offense not only against history but an offense against humanity, separating families,

135
00:21:01,652 --> 00:21:10,952
dividing husbands and wives and brothers and sisters, and dividing a people who wish to be joined together.

136
00:21:17,662 --> 00:21:28,552
What is true of this city is true of Germany—real, lasting peace in Europe can never be assured

137
00:21:28,552 --> 00:21:37,216
as long as one German out of four is denied the elementary right of free men,

138
00:21:37,216 --> 00:21:48,260
and that is to make a free choice. In 18 years of peace and good faith, this generation

139
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:57,293
of Germans has earned the right to be free, including the right to unite their families

140
00:21:57,293 --> 00:22:03,466
and their nation in lasting peace, with good will to all people.

141
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:21,505
You live in a defended island of freedom, but your life is part of the main.

142
00:22:21,505 --> 00:22:28,741
So let me ask you, as I close, to lift your eyes beyond the dangers of today,

143
00:22:28,741 --> 00:22:35,286
to the hopes of tomorrow, beyond the freedom merely of this city of Berlin,

144
00:22:35,286 --> 00:22:41,266
or your country of Germany, to the advance of freedom everywhere,

145
00:22:41,266 --> 00:22:46,888
beyond the wall to the day of peace with justice,

146
00:22:46,888 --> 00:22:52,939
beyond yourselves and ourselves to all mankind.

147
00:22:52,939 --> 00:23:01,438
Freedom is indivisible, and when one man is enslaved, all are not free.

148
00:23:01,438 --> 00:23:09,466
When all are free, then we can look forward to that day when this city will be

149
00:23:09,466 --> 00:23:15,802
joined as one and this country and this great Continent of Europe in a peaceful

150
00:23:15,802 --> 00:23:24,231
and hopeful globe. When that day finally comes, as it will, the people of West Berlin

151
00:23:24,231 --> 00:23:33,766
can take sober satisfaction in the fact that they were in the front lines for almost two decades.

152
00:23:49,764 --> 00:24:02,443
All free men, wherever they may live, are citizens of Berlin, and, therefore, as a free man,

153
00:24:02,443 --> 00:24:08,445
I take pride in the words "Ich bin ein Berliner!"
